A Text File named "Copy to UCUS-98645.txt" which contain codes for psp bricker and hijacker..

**Note From The Maker of Hijack:**
"Codes don't go with this. 
Enable the PRX and SocomPR Rev 2 and up then when you are in the SocomPR menu, press the R TRIGGER and switch to the 'X' tab. 
Then there you go! Hijacking. It's pretty much the same as SocomPR Rev 1 except v2 and up has the newer features."
